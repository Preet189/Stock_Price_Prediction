# Stock Price Prediction using Stacked LSTM Deep Learning
## Overview
This project aims to predict stock prices using a Stacked Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network. Stacked LSTM is a deep learning architecture that can capture long-term dependencies in sequential data, making it suitable for time-series prediction tasks like stock price forecasting.

## Requirements
Python 3.x,
TensorFlow,
Keras,
Pandas,
Numpy,
Matplotlib

## Dataset
This project uses historical stock price data for training and testing obtained from Tiingo. You will need to sign up for a Tiingo account and obtain an API key to access their data.

1. Sign up for a Tiingo account.
2. Once logged in, navigate to the API section to obtain your API token.
3. Copy the API token and paste it into the appropriate location in the code where the API key is required.
